# Enhancing User Experience: A Comparative Analysis and Redesign of Mobile Apps

This repository contains the analysis, redesign, and supporting files for a project conducted as part of the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** course at Sabanci University. The project focused on comparing the shopping procedures of two mobile applications, **Yemeksepeti** and **Trendyol Go**, and proposing a redesign to improve the efficiency and user experience of the Yemeksepeti app.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze the usability of two popular mobile apps, identify areas for improvement, and redesign one of the apps to enhance user experience. The project utilized Human-Computer Interaction principles, including Nielsen's Usability Heuristics, Fitts's Law, and Norman's concept of affordances.

### Project Structure

- **Analysis Report**: A detailed comparison of the shopping procedures in Yemeksepeti and Trendyol Go, highlighting the time differences and usability issues.
- **Redesign Proposal**: A comprehensive redesign of the Yemeksepeti app interface, aimed at reducing task completion time and improving overall usability.
- **CogTool Simulations**: CogTool models used to simulate the user interactions and measure task completion times before and after the redesign.
- **Supporting Documentation**: Includes references and supporting materials related to the project.
